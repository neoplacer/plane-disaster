<h1><a name="Origins_and_History"> Origins and History</a></h1>
<p>I wrote a database viewer due to the fact that I needed a way to
browse Microsoft Access files. I was working in C# at the time so that
was the language I chose. I wanted to make this an open source project
in the hopes of benifiting others.
</p>
<p>My project quickly grew to support several databases. I created
a nice hierarchy of classes that wrapped around ADO.NET Provider
classes. However, I then realized that I wasn't filling a need with the
MySQL and Postgres frontend. I prefer the existing frontends for
Postgresql, MySQL and Microsoft SQL server. As a result, I dropped
support for all databases besides MS access and SQLite. While there are
other front ends for SQLite available, I prefer PlaneDisaster to them
so I kept support for it. Also, SQLite and MS Access database are used
in similar manners and in both cases the database is just a file and
the database engine is just a shared library.
</p>
<h2><a name="The_Name_PlaneDisaster.NET">The Name PlaneDisaster.NET</a></h2>
<p>The prototype of PlaneDisaster.NET was a VB6 application called
PlaneCrash. The plane part of the name refers to the name of the MS
Access database engine JetSQL. The words Crash and Disaster refer to my
dislike of the JetSQL engine for its lack of scalability and features.
I might change the name if I can think of a better one.
</p>
<h1><a name="Features">Features</a></h1>
<ul>
  <li> Creating new databases
  </li>
  <li> Arbitrary SQL execution
  </li>
  <li> Can retrieve the contents of any table, view or procedure as a
CSV or DataGridView.
  </li>
  <li> "Scripting" of database objects
  </li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dd>You can retrieve the DDL of a database object. All objects
besides tables in JetSQL are supported. JetSQL has no mechanism for
giving you a "CREATE TABLE" statement that will exactly duplicate a
tables schema. There is much code that attempts to create the DDL by
examing the schema of the table. This feature would be good to
implement. I will gladly accept contributions in this regard.
  </dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <li> Microsoft Access specific features:
    <ul>
      <li> Database compacting. MDB files need to be periodically compacted to remove wasted space. PlaneDisaster.NET allows you to do this.
      </li>
      <li> Database Repair
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dd>The JetSQL Engine has a method of repairing corrupted
databases. I don't know how well it works, but I expose that
functionality here. This is the same repair database functionality
available from Microsoft Access.

<h2><a name="Versioning">Versioning</a></h2>
<p>
The first "official release" was 0.9. This is the current release.
Previous to that releases were labeles
PlaneDisaster.NET-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-alpha. I felt it was time to release
more formal versions.
</p>
<p>
Its quite stable and haven't broken any databases yet. I use the
latest SVN version on my production databases. All that being said,
backing up your database involves making a copy of one file, so you
have no excuses not to.
</p>
<p>
Future release plans are outlined below.

<h2><a name="Development_Roadmap">Development Roadmap</a></h2>
<p>The version release is as follows. I recently decided I didn't like
the lack of version numbers. I also had not done a release for a while.
After some thinking about it I did some coding, got it to a releasable
state and declared the release <b>0.9</b>. The 0.9 series will
continue until I release 1.0. I will probably be releasing version 1.0
shortly.
</p>
<h3> Previous Release (0.9.3) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> I catch an exception for when you attempt to display a table you lack permission to display. An error message is displayed. </li>
  <li> Added Jet2SQLite utility to convert a JetSQL database to SQLite. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Current Release (0.9.4) </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reverted changes that severely broke 0.9.3.</li>
  <li>You can execute the contents of the query window by Hitting F5.</li>
  <li>When you highlight text in the query window and hit execute, only the 
hightlighted text will be executed.</li>
  <li>The form will now render properly under Vista's default theme.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Upcoming Release (0.9.5) </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Jet2SQLite has an icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Beyond 1.0 </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Database utilities
    <ul>
      <li> The ability to upgrade or downgrade an existing JetSQL file. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> UI Changes
    <ul>
      <li> Display all tables, views, procedures, etc in one ListTree
on
the left as opposed to ListBoxes on the bottom. This makes it easier to
deal with different databases that have different types of objects. For
example I could make a category for System Tables, Linked tables and
Notmal tables for JetSQL databases.
      </li>
      <li>I want to replace the text box that serves as the query editor
with the text editor component that is part of <a href="http://laputa.sharpdevelop.net/AnnouncingSharpDevelopForApplicationsSDA.aspx">SharpDevelop for Applications (SDA)</a> or perhaps <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a> if I can find an appropiate .NET wrapper.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Contributors">Contributors</a></h2>
<p>If you send me a patch I'll look at it. If I like it I'll apply it
and submit it to SVN. You will get credit in the source and on this
page.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> User Rasha on the SQLite.NET forums showed me how to retrieve
the DDL of a table in SQLite.NET
  </li>
  <li> Dmitri Arkhangelski, author of  <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net">UltraDefrag</a> has provided me with valueable feedback that improved the gui resizing code.
