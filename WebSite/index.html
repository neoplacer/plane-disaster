<h1> Origins and History </h1>
<p>I wrote a database viewer due to the fact that I needed a way to
browse Microsoft Access files. I was working in C# at the time so that
was the language I chose. It made perfect sense to distribute this as
an open source project, as I knew of no open source tools for viewing
and editing MS access databases.
</p>
<p>My project quickly grew to support several databases. I created
a nice hierarchy of classes that wrapped around ADO.NET Provider
classes. However, I then realized that I wasn't filling a need with the
MySQL and Postgres frontend. I prefer the existing frontends for
Postgresql, MySQL and Microsoft SQL server. As a result, I dropped
support for all databases besides MS access and SQLite. While there are
other front ends for SQLite available, I prefer PlaneDisaster to them
so I kept support for it. Also, SQLite and MS Access database are used
in similar manners and in both cases the database is just a file and
the database engine is just a shared library.
</p>
<a name="The_Name_PlaneDisaster.NET"></a>
<h2> The Name PlaneDisaster.NET </h2>
<p>The prototype of PlaneDisaster.NET was a VB6 application called
PlaneCrash. The plane part of the name refers to the name of the MS
Access database engine JetSQL. The words Crash and Disaster refer to my
dislike of the JetSQL engine for its lack of scalability and features.
I might change the name if I can think of a better one.
</p>
<a name="Features"></a>
<h1> Features </h1>
<ul>
  <li> Creating new databases
  </li>
  <li> Arbitrary SQL execution
  </li>
  <li> Can retrieve the contents of any table, view or procedure as a
CSV or DataGridView.
  </li>
  <li> "Scripting" of database objects
  </li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dd>You can retrieve the DDL of a database object. All objects
besides tables in JetSQL are supported. JetSQL has no mechanism for
giving you a "CREATE TABLE" statement that will exactly duplicate a
tables schema. There is much code that attempts to create the DDL by
examing the schema of the table. This feature would be good to
implement. I will gladly accept contributions in this regard.
  </dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <li> Microsoft Access specific features:
    <ul>
      <li> Database compacting
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dd><i>MDB</i> files need to be periodically compacted to remove
wasted space. PlaneDisaster.NET allows you to do this.
  </dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li> Database Repair
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dd>The JetSQL Engine has a method of repairing corrupted
databases. I don't know how well it works, but I expose that
functionality here. This is the same repair database functionality
available from Microsoft Access.

<h1> Getting PlaneDisaster.NET </h1>
<p>PlaneDisaster.NET has a <a
 href="http://www.sf.net/projects/plane-disaster" class="external text"
 title="http://www.sf.net/projects/plane-disaster" rel="nofollow">project
page</a> on sourceforge. I make periodic releases. </p>
<a name="Versioning"></a>
<h2> Versioning </h2>
<p>The first "official release" was 0.9. This is the current release.
Previous to that releases were labeles
PlaneDisaster.NET-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-alpha. I felt it was time to release
more formal versions.
</p>
<p>Its quite stable and haven't broken any databases yet. However,
I've yet to arbitrarily declare a specific SVN revision an official
release. I use the latest SVN version on my production databases. All
that being said, backing up your database involves making a copy of one
file, so you have no excuses not to.
</p>
<p>Future release plans are outlined below.

<h2> Development Roadmap </h2>
<p>The version release is as follows. I recently decided I didn't like
the lack of version numbers. I also had not done a release for a while.
After some thinking about it I did some coding, got it to a releasable
state and declared the release <b>0.9</b>. The 0.9 series will
continue until I release 1.0. I will probably be releasing version 1.0
shortly.
</p>

ramifications of </li>
</ul>
<p>this. I have included the key in svn.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Made a separate class (PlaneDisaster) for the Main Function.
  </li>

database.

line.

longer </li>
</ul>

said data into another database.
  </li>
  <li> Fixed a bug where you could not display SQLite tables with more
than 500 rows by double clicking.
  </li>
  <li> Consolidated File opening code.
  </li>
  <li> Application gives a nice error if you open a non existant access
file.

<p><br>
</p>
<h3> Upcoming Release (0.9.2) </h3>
<ul>

    <ul>
      <li> SQLite
        <ul>
          <li> The ability to specify SQLite version 2 or three and to

<h3> Version 1.0 </h3>

  <li> UI Changes
    <ul>
      <li> Display all tables, views, procedures, etc in one ListTree
on
the left as opposed to ListBoxes on the bottom. This makes it easier to
deal with different databases that have different types of objects. For
example I could make a category for System Tables, Linked tables and
Notmal tables for JetSQL databases.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
